### What is Zsh and why should you care?
Zsh features themes, plugins, and advancements over default Bash and is compatible.

IT WILL MAKE THE TERMINAL EASY AND FUN TO USE.

### Ok, You're sold, now what?

1. Install with the package manager of your choice. Ex:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install zsh)
```
2. Verify installation by running zsh --version. Expected result: zsh 4.3.9 or more recent.
3. Make it your default shell: chsh -s $(COPY_PREVIOUS_OUTPUT_HERE)
4. Log out and login back again to use your new default shell.
5. Test that it worked with echo $SHELL. Expected result: /bin/zsh
