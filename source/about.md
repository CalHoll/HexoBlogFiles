**TL;DR** cool guy

I grew up in a pretty small community in Newfoundland, Canada. I have a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, and I am a lifelong computer geek.

At the time of writing, I have just completed week 1 of Hack Reactor's amazing program. I look to continue in my development as a Software Engineer after graduation of the program, and am excited about what future opportunities exist.
