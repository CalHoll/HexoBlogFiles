I grew up in a small community in Newfoundland, Canada. I have a bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I am a lifelong computer geek and lover of innovation.

At the time of writing, I have just completed week 3 of Hack Reactor's amazing program. I look to continue in my development as a Software Engineer after graduation of the program, and am excited about what future opportunities exist.
